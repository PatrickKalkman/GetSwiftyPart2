# GetSwiftyPart2 Homework assignment #4

Project #4 Contacts 

Details:
 
Open up your favorite mobile device, and navigate to the contact list. Take a few minutes to study the functionality available within that application. You'll likely see all of your contacts listed alphabetically. When you click on a contact, you'll see many different fields, all editable. Depending on your device/operating system, each contact may have a set-number of "tel" fields, or you may be able to add any number of different telephone-numbers for each contact. Continue to study the application and discover as much functionality as you can.

Now here's the hard part: Your task is to clone this application. Follow the same steps we did in this section of the course (defining the interface, planning the data model, etc), and recreate as much of the Contacts functionality as you can in your new app. Once you're done, add a few dummy contacts to your application to make sure it's working properly. Then try editing and deleting a few of them.

Important: You can skip any functionality that requires an integration with another app (such as the photo gallery, camera, Whatsapp, text messages, or the Phone dialer itself). You can also skip any 'search' related functionality unless you want to tackle the extra-credit below. 


Extra Credit:

Your device's contact-list app likely includes the option to search through all the contacts. Watch the bonus lecture above on Subject Search, and then try to recreate the search functionality within your app.

Video Component:

Make a screencast (or film a video) of the app you built, running either in the simulator or on a real device. Walk through all of the views of your app, showing off the user-stories and various pieces of functionality. If you're comfortable doing so, please narrate as you go, to explain what is being shown.

Turning it In:

One of the first slides in this course is called "How to Turn in Homework" review that slide for details on how to send your assignment to us (and receive a grade).
