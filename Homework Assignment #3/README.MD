Project #3 Card-Counter

Details:
 
In a casino, there's usually only one game that gives gamblers have a shot at consistently beating  the house: Blackjack (aka "21"). But winning requires a special skill: the ability to "count cards". It's a difficult skill, and takes time and practice to master.

For this assignment, you are to build a "card counter" app to help gamblers win at blackjack. Your app should allow the gambler to enter what cards are being dealt, as they happen, and should guide them as to how to bet and play, accordingly. Specifically they should be able to:

1. Mark that a new deck is being opened/used by the dealer

2. Enter which cards have been drawn, hand by hand (and which player has received them)

3. Receive guidance from the app on whether to "hit" or "stay" at any given moment.

4. Receive guidance from the app regarding how large of a bet they should be placing at any given time (use the system explained in the youtube video above to guide your development).


Extra Credit:

If a gambler gets caught using an app like this, they'll probably get kicked out of the casino. Disguise your app so that nobody can tell what the player is doing. Choose any disguise you wish. It could look like a Tetris game, or a messaging app for example, as long as the user can still covertly use it to win at blackjack. If you choose this disguised route, provide instructions on how the user can use it.

Video Requirement:

This assignment contains a video component. When you've completed your app, please push the code to Github as normal (and submit it to us). But please also take this extra step:

1. Make a screencast (or film a video) of the app you built, running either in the simulator or on a real device.

2. Walk through all of the views of your app, showing off the user-stories and various pieces of functionality.

3. If you're comfortable doing so, please narrate as you go, to explain what is being shown.

4. See the "How to Turn In Homework" slide for instructions on how to submit the video.


Turning it In:

One of the first slides in this course is called "How to Turn in Homework" review that slide for details on how to send your assignment to us (and receive a grade). There's a section of that slide that applies specifically to video-based assignments.

And that's it! You're done. When we see this post come through, we'll look back over all your other homework submissions, and give you feedback on anything that needs work. If everything looks like, we'll create a completion certificate for you, and send it your way.
