# GetSwiftyPart2 Homework assignment #1

Project #1: Build a Stopwatch

Details:
 
Your assignment is to build a stopwatch app:

1. When opened it should display a blank screen with a "start" button

2. When the button is clicked, the elapsed time should appear on the screen, as well as a "stop" button.

3. When the "stop button is clicked" the timer should freeze at the current moment, and two buttons should display: "resume" and "reset".

4. If "resume" is clicked, the timer should continue counting from the moment it was paused. If "reset" is clicked, the screen should only display a "start" button once again.


Video Requirement:

This assignment contains a video component. When you've completed your app, please push the code to Github as normal (and submit it to us). But please also take this extra step:

1. Make a screencast (or film a video) of the app you built, running either in the simulator or on a real device.

2. Walk through all of the views of your app, showing off the user-stories and various pieces of functionality.

3. If you're comfortable doing so, please narrate as you go, to explain what is being shown.

4. See the "How to Turn In Homework" slide for instructions on how to submit the video.


Turning it In:

One of the first slides in this course is called "How to Turn in Homework" review that slide for details on how to send your assignment to us (and receive a grade). There's a section of that slide that applies specifically to video-based assignments.

And that's it! You're done. When we see this post come through, we'll look back over all your other homework submissions, and give you feedback on anything that needs work. If everything looks like, we'll create a completion certificate for you, and send it your way.
