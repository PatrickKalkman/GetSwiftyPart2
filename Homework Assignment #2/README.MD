Project #2: Build a Metric to Imperial Converter


Details:
 
Your assignment is to build a Metric to Imperial app:

1. When opened it should display a title, welcome message, and a dropdown that lets you select either "weight", "length", or "volume"

2. When an option is selected, the user should be taken to a form when they can enter a number, select a corresponding starting unit (such as "millimeters" or "gallons"), select an ending unit (such as "feet" or "liters"), and click a button that says "convert"

3. Once the "convert" button is clicked, the result should be displayed on the screen, as well as a "start over" button that takes the user back to the home screen.

4. Make sure your app allows users to convert between any of the following (once they choose the appropriate selection on the home page). It should also allow them to convert in either direction (Metric to Imperial but also Imperial to Metric).

Weight:
Pounds
Ounces
Stone
Milligrams
Grams
Kilograms
Tons


Length:
Inches
Feet
Yards
Miles
Millimeters
Centimeters
Meters
Kilometers


Volume:
Teaspoon
Tablespoon
Cups
Quarts
Gallons
Milliliters
Deciliters
Liters

Extra Credit:

Although not strictly part of the Imperial / Metric regimes, add a 4th option to your converter: "Temperature", which allows the user to switch between degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Video Requirement:

This assignment contains a video component. When you've completed your app, please push the code to Github as normal (and submit it to us). But please also take this extra step:

1. Make a screencast (or film a video) of the app you built, running either in the simulator or on a real device.

2. Walk through all of the views of your app, showing off the user-stories and various pieces of functionality.

3. If you're comfortable doing so, please narrate as you go, to explain what is being shown.

4. See the "How to Turn In Homework" slide for instructions on how to submit the video.


Turning it In:

One of the first slides in this course is called "How to Turn in Homework" review that slide for details on how to send your assignment to us (and receive a grade). There's a section of that slide that applies specifically to video-based assignments.

And that's it! You're done. When we see this post come through, we'll look back over all your other homework submissions, and give you feedback on anything that needs work. If everything looks like, we'll create a completion certificate for you, and send it your way.
